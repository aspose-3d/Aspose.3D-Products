 In order to render VRML to PLY, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily convert VRML file to PLY in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of PlySaveOptions
1.  Set PLY specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with PLY file extension & object of PlySaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PLY" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/ply/" >}}

PLY, Polygon File Format, represents 3D file format that stores graphical objects described as a collection of polygons. The purpose of this file format was to establish a simple and easy file type that is general enough to be useful for a wide range of models. PLY file format comes as ASCII as well as Binary format for compact storage and for rapid saving and loading. The file format is used by different applications that provide support for 3D files reading.
