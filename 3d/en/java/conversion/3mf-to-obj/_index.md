 In order to render 3MF to OBJ, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily convert 3MF file to OBJ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load 3MF file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of ObjSaveOptions
1.  Set OBJ specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with OBJ file extension & object of ObjSaveOptions

 Before running the Java conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.3D for Java directly from Maven.

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

3MF, 3D Manufacturing Format, is used by applications to render 3D object models to a variety of other applications, platforms, services and printers. It was built to avoid the limitations and issues in other 3D file formats, like STL, for working with the latest versions of 3D printers. 3MF is relatively a new file format that has been developed and published by the 3MF consortium. It is rich enough to fully describe a model, retaining internal information, colour, and other characteristics that makes it extensible for supporting new innovations in 3D printing. The format is extensible, able to be broadly adopted and free of issues besetting other widely used file formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OBJ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}

OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.
