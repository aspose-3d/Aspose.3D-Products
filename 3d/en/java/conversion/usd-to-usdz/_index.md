        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="USD" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/usd/" >}}

A file with .usd extension is a Universal Scene Description file format that encodes data for the purpose of data interchanging and augmenting between digital content creation applications. Developed by Pixar, USD provides the ability to interchange elemental assets (such as models) or animation.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="USDZ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/usdz/" >}}

A file with .usdz is an uncompressed and unencrypetd ZIP archive for the USD (Universal Scene Description) file format that contains and proxies for files of other formats (such as textures, and animations) embedded within the archive and runs them directly with the USD run-time without any need of unpacking. USDZ files are packages whose design is based on the new Ar-level abstraction of a package. Usdz was registered with IANA and has media type name of model and a subtype name of vnd.usd+zip and its details can be found as on IANA registration page.
