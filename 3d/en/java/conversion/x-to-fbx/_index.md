 In order to render X to FBX, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily convert X file to FBX in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load X file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of FbxSaveOptions
1.  Set FBX specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with FBX file extension & object of FbxSaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

X is a DirectX Model image file used by DirectX technology which is for 3D graphics rendering in games. The file format specifies 3D object structures for meshes, textures, animations, and objects.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="FBX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/fbx/" >}}

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.
