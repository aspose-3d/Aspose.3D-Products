In order to watermark verification RVM file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use watermark verification API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily add blind watermark verification to RVM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load RVM file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add password using Aspose.3D's DecodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="JAVA code to Add Blind Watermark Verification to RVM" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

//Source files that need to be watermarked for verification
String file = "template.rvm";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);
final String[] text = {null};

//Add password to verify watermark by DecodeWatermark method
try {
    scene.getRootNode().accept((Node node) ->
    {
        Entity mesh = node.getEntity();
        if (mesh != null) {
            text[0] = com.aspose.threed.Watermark.decodeWatermark((Mesh)mesh, "1234");
            if (text[0] != null)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    });
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    return "Password error";
}

//Returns null if this file has no watermark,If there is a watermark, return the watermark content
return text[0];
