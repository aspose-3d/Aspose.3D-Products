In order to generate point cloud to RVM file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use point cloud API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily generate point cloud to RVM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load RVM file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get pointcloud object of Aspose.3D
-  Create a transform object through the EvaluateGlobalTransform method
-  Generate point cloud using Merge method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.
