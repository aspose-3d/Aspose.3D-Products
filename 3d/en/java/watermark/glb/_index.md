In order to watermark GLB file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use watermark API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily add blind watermark to GLB in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load GLB file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add watermark and password using Aspose.3D's EncodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

```cs
//The source file that needs to be watermarked and the output file after saving
String file = "template.glb";

AtomicInteger numMeshes = new AtomicInteger();

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GLB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/glb/" >}}

GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL transmission format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.
