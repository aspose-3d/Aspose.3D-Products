 Java programmers can easily view PLY in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load PLY file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Create an instance of Html5SaveOptions
-  Set properties for advanced formatting
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object of Html5SaveOptions
-  Check resultant HTML file in default browser

```cs

//The source file to be viewed and the output file after saving
String file = "template.ply";
String output = "outFile.html";

// load scene via an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
scene.open(file, FileFormat.PLY);

// create an object of Html5SaveOptions and set properties for formatting
Html5SaveOptions option=new Html5SaveOptions();
// turn off the grid
option.setShowGrid(false);
// turn off the user interface
option.setShowUI(false);

// save 3D scene as HTML5,load the HTML5 file through the browser yourself
scene.save(output, option);

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

PLY, polygon file format, represents 3D file format that stores graphical objects described as a collection of polygons. The purpose of this file format was to establish a simple and easy file type that is general enough to be useful for a wide range of models. PLY file format comes as ASCII as well as binary format for compact storage and for rapid saving and loading.
