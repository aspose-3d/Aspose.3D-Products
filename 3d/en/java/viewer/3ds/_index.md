 Java programmers can easily view 3DS in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load 3DS file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Create an instance of Html5SaveOptions
-  Set properties for advanced formatting
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object of Html5SaveOptions
-  Check resultant HTML file in default browser

```cs

//The source file to be viewed and the output file after saving
String file = "template.3ds";
String output = "outFile.html";

// load scene via an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene();

// create an object of Html5SaveOptions and set properties for formatting
Html5SaveOptions option=new Html5SaveOptions();
// turn off the grid
option.setShowGrid(false);
// turn off the user interface
option.setShowUI(false);

// save 3D scene as HTML5,load the HTML5 file through the browser yourself
scene.save(output, option);

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
