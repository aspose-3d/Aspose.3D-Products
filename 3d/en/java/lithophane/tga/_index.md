In order to create your lithophane from TGA file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use lithophane API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily create your lithophane from TGA in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Create some new parameters and create a Mesh object
-  Perform computational operations on Mesh objects
-  TGA file loads 3d scene through Mesh class
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.
