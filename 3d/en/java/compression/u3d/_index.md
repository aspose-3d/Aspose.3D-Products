In order to compress U3D file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use compression API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily compress U3D in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load U3D file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Define the output path of the compressed file
-  Create an instance of SaveOptions
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

```cs
//The source file to be compressed and the output file after saving
String file = "template.u3d";
String output = "outFile.fbx";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
scene.open(file, FileFormat.UNIVERSAL3D);

//Save the compressed format you want
scene.save(output, FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="U3D" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/u3d/" >}}

U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards).
