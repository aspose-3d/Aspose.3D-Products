 In order to convert PLY to USDZ, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert PLY files to USDZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PLY file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with USDZ's format.
1.  Check resultant USDZ file at specified path

PLY, Polygon File Format, represents 3D file format that stores graphical objects described as a collection of polygons. The purpose of this file format was to establish a simple and easy file type that is general enough to be useful for a wide range of models. PLY file format comes as ASCII as well as Binary format for compact storage and for rapid saving and loading. The file format is used by different applications that provide support for 3D files reading.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="usdz" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/usdz/" >}}
A file with .usdz is an uncompressed and unencrypetd ZIP archive for the USD (Universal Scene Description) file format that contains and proxies for files of other formats (such as textures, and animations) embedded within the archive and runs them directly with the USD run-time without any need of unpacking. USDZ files are packages whose design is based on the new Ar-level abstraction of a package. Usdz was registered with IANA and has media type name of model and a subtype name of vnd.usd+zip and its details can be found as on IANA registration page.
