 In order to convert VRML to DAE, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert VRML files to DAE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Set DAE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with DAE file extension & object of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant DAE file at specified path

 Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.3D for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

```cs
// load the VRML in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.vrml");
// create an instance of DaeSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.DaeSaveOptions();
// save VRML as a DAE 
document.Save("output.dae", options);

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VRML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/vrml/" >}}
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="dae" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/dae/" >}}
A DAE file is a Digital Asset Exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506.
