Developers can easily read, create, convert, update and control the substance of 3D formats easily using 3D graphics library. Few of the supported formats by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary),  Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF,  PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats and more. Conversion process is easily as to loading the source file via instance of [Scene class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), and calling the Save method with relevant output format parameter.

Developers can easily convert 3D scene through the same process listed above. Considering few examples such as **FBX to OBJ conversion**. Load the FBX file via Scene Class object.  Create the saving options using [ObjSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/objsaveoptions) and call the scene Save method having output file path and obj options as parameters. API has appropriate options classes for saving into relevant classes like [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions) [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions) [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions) [FbxSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/fbxsaveoptions) [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is complete list for 3D [conversion format](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options. Moreover, developers can easily save a 3D scene into PDF.
