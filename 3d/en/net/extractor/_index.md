Developers can use the 3D library to easily extract 3D file assets. Few formats supported by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats, etc. The extraction process is simple, load the source file through an instance of the [scene class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), create the archive class and handle the extraction asset class, and call the The Save method for the relevant output format parameter.

Developers can easily extract assets from 3d files through the same process listed above. Consider some examples like **3DS to FBX Extractor**. Load 3DS files via scene class objects. Create save options with [FbxSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/fbxSaveOptions) to create save options and call the scene save method with the output file path and fbx options arguments. The API has appropriate options classes for saving into related classes, e.g. [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions) [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions) [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions) [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is the full list of 3D [extractor formats](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options.
