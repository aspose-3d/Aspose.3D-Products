 In order to compress VRML file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with compress any 3D file. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to compress the VRML file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load VRML file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Define the output path of the compressed file
-  Create an instance of SaveOptions
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Aspose.3D for .NET is supported on all major operating systems. Just make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio
-  Aspose.3D for .NET referenced in your project

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# code to Compress VRML" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

//The source file that needs to be compressed and the output file after saving
string file = "template.vrml";
string output =System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".fbx";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);

// create an instance of AmfSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.FbxSaveOptions(FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);

//Save the file in the format you want
scene.Save(output, options);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VRML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/vrml/" >}}
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can save objects and scenes in VRML format.
