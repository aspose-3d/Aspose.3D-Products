 In order to compress U3D file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with compress any 3D file. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to compress the U3D file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load U3D file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Define the output path of the compressed file
-  Create an instance of SaveOptions
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# code to Compress U3D" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

//The source file that needs to be compressed and the output file after saving
string file = "template.u3d";
string output =System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".fbx";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);

// create an instance of AmfSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.FbxSaveOptions(FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);

//Save the file in the format you want
scene.Save(output, options);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards).
