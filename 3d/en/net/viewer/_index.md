Developers can use the 3D graphics library to easily read, create, transform, update and control content in 3D formats. Few formats supported by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats, etc. The viewing process is very simple, load the source file through an instance of the [scene class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), and call the Save method with the relevant output format parameters.

Developers can easily view 3d files through the same process listed above. Consider some examples like **3DS to HTML5 viewing**. Load 3DS files via scene class objects. Create save options using [Html5SaveOptions ](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5SaveOptions) to create save options and call the scene save method with the output file path and html5 options arguments. The API has appropriate options classes for saving into related classes, e.g. [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions) [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions) [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions) [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is the full list of 3D [viewer formats](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options.
