Developers can easily create your Lithophane using the 3D library. Few formats supported by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats, etc. The creation process is very simple, load the source file through an instance of the [scene class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), perform calculation operations on the Mesh object, and call with the relevant output The Save method of the format parameter.

Developers can easily create your Lithophane through the same process listed above. Consider some examples like **BMP to FBX lithophane**. Load BMP files through scene class objects. Create save options with [FbxSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/fbxSaveOptions) to create save options and call the scene save method with the output file path and fbx options arguments. The API has appropriate options classes for saving into related classes, e.g. [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions) [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions) [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions) [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is the full list of 3D [Lithophane formats](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options.
