Developers can use the 3D library to add blind watermarks to 3D files. Few formats supported by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats, etc. The process of adding a blind watermark is very simple. Load the source file through the instance of [Scene Class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), and then implement the watermark through the EncodeWatermark method of the 3D library.

Developers can easily add blind watermarks to 3d files through the same process listed above. Consider a few examples, such as **3DS to FBX watermark**. Load 3DS files through scene class objects. Create the saving options using [FbxSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/fbxSaveOptions) to create save options and call the scene Save method with the output file path and fbx options as parameters. API has appropriate options classes for saving into relevant classes like [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions)  [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions)  [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions)  [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is complete list for 3D [Watermark format](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options.
