Developers can easily merge 3D files using the 3D library. Few formats supported by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats, etc. The merging process is very simple. It processes the files to be merged in a loop, loads the usdz file through an instance of [scene class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), processes the usdz file and calls the file with The Save method for the relevant output format parameter.

Developers can easily merge 3d files through the same process listed above. Consider some examples like **3DS to FBX merger**. Load 3DS files via scene class objects. Create save options using [FbxSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/fbxSaveOptions) to create save options and call the scene save method with the output file path and fbx options arguments. The API has appropriate options classes for saving into related classes, e.g. [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions) [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions) [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions) [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is the full list of 3D [merger formats](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options.
