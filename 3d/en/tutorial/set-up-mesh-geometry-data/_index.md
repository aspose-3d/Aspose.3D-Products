//ExSummary: Please review the following code that demonstrates how to set up mesh geometry data. You can make changes to the code and run it directly in your browser.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code shows how to create a new 3D scene and add color data.

//Create a new 3D scene
Scene scene = new Scene();

// Define color vectors
Vector3[] colors = new Vector3[] {new Vector3(0,30,40)};

//ExStep:1-
// Initialize object by Torus class
IMeshConvertible convertible = new Torus();

//Convert a Torus to Mesh
Mesh mesh = convertible.ToMesh();

// Initialize cube node object
Node cube = new Node("cube");

//Point node to the Mesh geometry
cube.Entity = mesh;

// Add cube node to a scene
scene.RootNode.ChildNodes.Add(cube);

//ExStep:2-
//Initialize Lambert material object
LambertMaterial mat = new LambertMaterial();

//Set color
mat.DiffuseColor = colors[0];

//Set material
cube.Material = mat;

//Set translation
cube.Transform.Translation = new Vector3(2, 0, 0);

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to set up mesh geometry data.

We will set the data for the color. We initialize an <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.entities/imeshconvertible/">IMeshConvertible</a> object using the Torus class, initialize a node object, and add it to the scene. Finally, we initialize a <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.shading/lambertmaterial/">LambertMaterial</a> object and set the color data. We can clearly see the changes in it.
