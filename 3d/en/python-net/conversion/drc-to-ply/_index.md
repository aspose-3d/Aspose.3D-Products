 In order to convert DRC to PLY, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert DRC files to PLY in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DRC file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set PLY specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with PLY file extension & object of PlySaveOptions
1.  Check resultant PLY file at specified path

```cs
# load the DRC in an object of Scene 
document = aspose.threed.Scene.from_file("template.drc");
# create an instance of PlySaveOptions 
options = aspose.threed.formats.PlySaveOptions();
# save DRC as a PLY 
document.save("output.ply", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

A file with .drc extension is a compressed 3D file format created with Google Draco library. Google offers Draco as open source library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes and point clouds, and improves storage and transmission of 3D graphics. It encodes the input data and saves it as .drc file. At the receiving end, the API reads .drc files and can output these as PLY or OBJ files. The compressed output file enables users to download apps faster and provide quick loading of 3D graphics in browsers.

PLY, Polygon File Format, represents 3D file format that stores graphical objects described as a collection of polygons. The purpose of this file format was to establish a simple and easy file type that is general enough to be useful for a wide range of models. PLY file format comes as ASCII as well as Binary format for compact storage and for rapid saving and loading. The file format is used by different applications that provide support for 3D files reading.
