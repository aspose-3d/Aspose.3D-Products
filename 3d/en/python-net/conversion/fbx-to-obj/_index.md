 In order to convert FBX to OBJ, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert FBX files to OBJ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load FBX file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of ObjSaveOptions
1.  Set OBJ specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with OBJ file extension & object of ObjSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant OBJ file at specified path

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="obj" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}
OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.
