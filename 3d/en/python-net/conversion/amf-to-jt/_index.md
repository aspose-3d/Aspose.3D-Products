 In order to convert AMF to JT, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert AMF files to JT in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load AMF file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.save method with JT's format.
1.  Check resultant JT file at specified path

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="AMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/amf/" >}}
An AMF file consists of guidelines for objects description in order to be used by Additive Manufacturing processes. It contains an opening XML tag and ends with a element. This is preceded by an XML declaration line specifying the XML version and encoding of the file. The declarations can include measurement units information and, in the absence of such information, millimetres are used as default unit.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="jt" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/jt/" >}}
JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format.
