 In order to convert VRML to U3D, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert VRML files to U3D in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of U3dSaveOptions
1.  Set U3D specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with U3D file extension & object of U3dSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant U3D file at specified path

 Before running the Python conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS.
-  Python 3.5 or later.
-  Aspose.3D for Python referenced in your project.

```cs
# load the VRML in an object of Scene 
document = aspose.threed.Scene.from_file("template.vrml");
# create an instance of U3dSaveOptions 
options = aspose.threed.formats.U3dSaveOptions();
# save VRML as a U3D 
document.save("output.u3d", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="u3d" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/u3d/" >}}
U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards). U3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.
