 In order to convert JPEG to PDF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert JPEG files to PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JPEG file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of PdfSaveOptions
1.  Set PDF specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with PDF file extension & object of PdfSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant PDF file at specified path

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
