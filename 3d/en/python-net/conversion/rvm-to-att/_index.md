 In order to convert RVM to ATT, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Python programmers can easily load & convert RVM files to ATT in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load RVM file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set ATT specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with ATT file extension & object of AttSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant ATT file at specified path
