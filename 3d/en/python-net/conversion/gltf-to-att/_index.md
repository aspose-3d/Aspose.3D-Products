 In order to convert GLTF to ATT, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Python programmers can easily load & convert GLTF files to ATT in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load GLTF file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set ATT specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with ATT file extension & object of AttSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant ATT file at specified path

```cs
# load the GLTF in an object of Scene 
document = aspose.threed.Scene.from_file("template.gltf");
# create an instance of AttSaveOptions 
options = aspose.threed.formats.AttSaveOptions();
# save GLTF as a ATT 
document.save("output.att", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

glTF (GL Transmission Format) is a 3D file format that stores 3D model information in JSON format. The use of JSON minimizes both the size of 3D assets and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. It was adopted for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF was developed by the Khronos Group 3D Formats Working Group and is also described as JPEG of 3D by its creators. The format defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry. The intention behind the creation of glTF file format was to define an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that should streamline authoring workflows and enable interoperable use of content across the industry. It minimizes runtime processing by applications using WebGL and other APIs.
