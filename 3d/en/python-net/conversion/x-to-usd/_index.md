        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="X" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/x/" >}}
A file with .x extension refers to DirectX 3D Graphics legacy file format that was introduced with Microsoft DirectX 2.0. It was used for 3D graphics rendering in games and specifies the structures for meshes, textures, animations, and user-defined objects. It has been deprecated since 2014 as the Autodesk FBX file format serves better as a more modern format. X is template-driven and is free of any usage knowledge. You can open DirectX X files using Microsoft DirectX and common text editors.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="usd" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/usd/" >}}
A file with .usd extension is a Universal Scene Description file format that encodes data for the purpose of data interchanging and augmenting between digital content creation applications. Developed by Pixar, USD provides the ability to interchange elemental assets (such as models) or animation.
