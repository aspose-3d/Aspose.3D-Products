 In order to convert JT to USD, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert JT files to USD in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JT file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.save method with USD's format.
1.  Check resultant USD file at specified path
