 In order to convert 3DS to U3D, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert 3DS files to U3D in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load 3DS file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of U3dSaveOptions
1.  Set U3D specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with U3D file extension & object of U3dSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant U3D file at specified path

 Before running the Python conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS.
-  Python 3.5 or later.
-  Aspose.3D for Python referenced in your project.

```cs
# load the 3DS in an object of Scene 
document = aspose.threed.Scene.from_file("template.3ds");
# create an instance of U3dSaveOptions 
options = aspose.threed.formats.U3dSaveOptions();
# save 3DS as a U3D 
document.save("output.u3d", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="u3d" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/u3d/" >}}
U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards). U3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.
