 In order to convert RVM to USDZ, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert RVM files to USDZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load RVM file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.save method with USDZ's format.
1.  Check resultant USDZ file at specified path

RVM data files are related to AVEVA PDMS. RVM file is an AVEVA Plant Design Management System Model project file. AVEVA&rsquo;s Plant Design Management System (PDMS) is the most popular 3D design system using data-centric technology for managing projects. Numerous applications are available to open and convert RVM files to other formats such as 3DS.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="usdz" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/usdz/" >}}
A file with .usdz is an uncompressed and unencrypetd ZIP archive for the USD (Universal Scene Description) file format that contains and proxies for files of other formats (such as textures, and animations) embedded within the archive and runs them directly with the USD run-time without any need of unpacking. USDZ files are packages whose design is based on the new Ar-level abstraction of a package. Usdz was registered with IANA and has media type name of model and a subtype name of vnd.usd+zip and its details can be found as on IANA registration page.
