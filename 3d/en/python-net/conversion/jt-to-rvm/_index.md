 In order to convert JT to RVM, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert JT files to RVM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JT file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of RvmSaveOptions
1.  Set RVM specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with RVM file extension & object of RvmSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant RVM file at specified path

```cs
# load the JT in an object of Scene 
document = aspose.threed.Scene.from_file("template.jt");
# create an instance of RvmSaveOptions 
options = aspose.threed.formats.RvmSaveOptions();
# save JT as a RVM 
document.save("output.rvm", options);

JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format. JT format is a scene graph that supports the attributes and nodes that are CAD specific. Sophisticated compression techniques are used to store facet data (triangles). This format is structured to support visual attributes, product and manufacturing information (PMI), and Metadata. There is a good support for asynchronous streaming of content. In heavy mechanical industry, professionals use JT file in their CAD solutions and product lifecycle management (PLM) software programs to examine the geometry of complicated goods.
