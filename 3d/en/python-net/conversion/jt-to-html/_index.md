 In order to convert JT to HTML, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert JT files to HTML in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JT file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of HtmlSaveOptions
1.  Set HTML specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with HTML file extension & object of HtmlSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant HTML file at specified path

JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format. JT format is a scene graph that supports the attributes and nodes that are CAD specific. Sophisticated compression techniques are used to store facet data (triangles). This format is structured to support visual attributes, product and manufacturing information (PMI), and Metadata. There is a good support for asynchronous streaming of content. In heavy mechanical industry, professionals use JT file in their CAD solutions and product lifecycle management (PLM) software programs to examine the geometry of complicated goods.

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages. The latest variant is known as HTML 5 that gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from server, where these are hosted, or can be loaded from local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others where each tag has start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.
