 In order to convert VRML to GLB, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert VRML files to GLB in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.save method with GLB's format.
1.  Check resultant GLB file at specified path

 Before running the Python conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or Linux based OS.
-  Python 3.5 or later.
-  Aspose.3D for Python referenced in your project.

```cs
# Load the source VRML file
Scene scene = new Scene.from_file("sourceFile.wrl");
# Convert the 3D scene to file in Binary GLTF format
scene.save("output.glb", FileFormat.GLTF2_Binary)
```

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VRML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/vrml/" >}}
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="glb" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/glb/" >}}
GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.
