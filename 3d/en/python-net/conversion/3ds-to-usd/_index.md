 In order to convert 3DS to USD, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert 3DS files to USD in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load 3DS file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.save method with USD's format.
1.  Check resultant USD file at specified path

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="3DS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3ds/" >}}
A file with .3ds extension represents 3D Sudio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
