 In order to generate point cloud to PDF file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with generate point cloud. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to generate point cloud to the PDF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load PDF file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get pointcloud object of Aspose.3D
-  Create a transform object through the EvaluateGlobalTransform method
-  Generate point cloud using Merge method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/" >}}
Portable document format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as operating system. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins.
