 In order to compress DXF file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with compress any 3D file. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to compress the DXF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load DXF file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Define the output path of the compressed file
-  Create an instance of SaveOptions
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for Python API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DXF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dxf/" >}}
DXF, drawing interchange format, or drawing exchange format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file.
