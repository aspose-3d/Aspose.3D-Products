 In order to watermark DAE file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with add any watermark. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to add blind watermark to the DAE file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load DAE file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add watermark and password using Aspose.3D's EncodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DAE" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/dae/" >}}
A DAE file is a digital asset exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506.
