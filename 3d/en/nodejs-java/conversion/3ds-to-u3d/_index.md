 In order to convert 3DS to U3D, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/nodejs-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Node.js. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/)
 and by adding configuration in pom.xml.
 You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Node.js programmers can easily load & convert 3DS files to U3D in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load 3DS file via the Scene class
1.  Create an instance of U3dSaveOptions
1.  Set U3D specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with U3D file extension & object of U3dSaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="3DS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3ds/" >}}
A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="U3D" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/u3d/" >}}
U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards). U3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.
