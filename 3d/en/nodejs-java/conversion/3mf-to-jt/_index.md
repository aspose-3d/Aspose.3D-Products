 In order to convert 3MF to JT, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/nodejs-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Node.js. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/)
 and by adding configuration in pom.xml.
 You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Node.js programmers can easily load & convert 3MF files to JT in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load 3MF file via the fromFile of Scene class
1.  Call the Scene.save method with JT's format.
1.  Check resultant JT file at specified path

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="3MF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf/" >}}
3MF, 3D Manufacturing Format, is used by applications to render 3D object models to a variety of other applications, platforms, services and printers. It was built to avoid the limitations and issues in other 3D file formats, like STL, for working with the latest versions of 3D printers. 3MF is relatively a new file format that has been developed and published by the 3MF consortium. It is rich enough to fully describe a model, retaining internal information, colour, and other characteristics that makes it extensible for supporting new innovations in 3D printing. The format is extensible, able to be broadly adopted and free of issues besetting other widely used file formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JT" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/jt/" >}}
JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format.
