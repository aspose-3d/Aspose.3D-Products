 In order to extract assets from ASE file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/nodejs-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Node.js platform to be used with extract assets. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/)
 and by adding configuration in pom.xml.
 You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to extract assets from the ASE file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load ASE file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Create zip file format object as output file format
-  Create archive class and handle extract asset class
-  Call the Extract method and save the file
