 In order to watermark U3D file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/nodejs-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Node.js platform to be used with add any watermark. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/)
 and by adding configuration in pom.xml.
 You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to add blind watermark to the U3D file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load U3D file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add watermark and password using Aspose.3D's EncodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="U3D" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/u3d/" >}}
U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards).
