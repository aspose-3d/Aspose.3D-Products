 In order to compress GLTF file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/nodejs-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Node.js platform to be used with compress any 3D file. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/3d/)
 and by adding configuration in pom.xml.
 You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to compress the GLTF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load GLTF file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Define the output path of the compressed file
-  Create an instance of SaveOptions
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for Node.js API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GLTF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/gltf/" >}}
glTF (GL transmission format) is a 3D file format that stores 3D model information in JSON format. The use of JSON minimizes both the size of 3D assets and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. It was adopted for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications.
