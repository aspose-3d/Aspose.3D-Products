 In order to render U3D to DAE, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.3D API makes it easy for the developers to convert U3D file to DAE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load U3D file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Set DAE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with DAE file extension & object of DaeSaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="U3D" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/u3d/" >}}

U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards). U3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DAE" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/dae/" >}}

A DAE file is a Digital Asset Exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506.
