 In order to render RVM to OBJ, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily convert RVM file to OBJ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load RVM file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of ObjSaveOptions
1.  Set OBJ specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with OBJ file extension & object of ObjSaveOptions

 Before running the Java conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.3D for Java directly from Maven.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="RVM to OBJ Java Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the RVM in an object of Scene 
Scene document = new Scene("template.rvm");
// create an instance of ObjSaveOptions 
ObjSaveOptions options = new ObjSaveOptions();
// save RVM as a OBJ 
document.save("output.obj", options);

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

RVM data files are related to AVEVA PDMS. RVM file is an AVEVA Plant Design Management System Model. AVEVA's Plant Design Management System (PDMS) is the most popular 3D design system using data-centric technology for managing projects.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OBJ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}

OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.
