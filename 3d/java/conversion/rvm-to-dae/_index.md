 In order to render RVM to DAE, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily convert RVM file to DAE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load RVM file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Set DAE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with DAE file extension & object of DaeSaveOptions

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the Java conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.3D for Java directly from Maven.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="RVM to DAE Java Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the RVM in an object of Scene 
Scene document = new Scene("template.rvm");
// create an instance of DaeSaveOptions 
DaeSaveOptions options = new DaeSaveOptions();
// save RVM as a DAE 
document.save("output.dae", options);

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DAE" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/dae/" >}}

A DAE file is a Digital Asset Exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506.
