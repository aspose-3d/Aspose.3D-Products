1.  Load ASE file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set AMF specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with AMF file extension & object of AmfSaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

An ASE file is a 2D animation or graphics that contain layers, frames, palettes, tags, and settings.

    {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="AMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/amf/" >}}
Additive Manufacturing file format (AMF) defines open standards for objects description in order to be utilized by additive manufacturing processes such as 3D Printing. CAD programs use the AMF file format by making use of the information such as geometry, color and material of the objects. AMF is different than STL format as the lateral does not support color, materials, lattices, and constellations.
