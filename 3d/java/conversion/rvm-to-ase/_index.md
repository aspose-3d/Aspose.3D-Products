 In order to render RVM to ASE, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.3D API makes it easy for the developers to convert RVM file to ASE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load RVM file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AseSaveOptions
1.  Set ASE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with ASE file extension & object of AseSaveOptions
