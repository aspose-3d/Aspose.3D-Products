 Aspose.3D API makes it easy for the developers to convert X file to ASE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load X file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AseSaveOptions
1.  Set ASE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with ASE file extension & object of AseSaveOptions
