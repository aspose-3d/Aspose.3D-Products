 In order to render PLY to DRC, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.3D API makes it easy for the developers to convert PLY file to DRC in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PLY file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of DrcSaveOptions
1.  Set DRC specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with DRC file extension & object of DrcSaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats. ‎

PLY, Polygon File Format, represents 3D file format that stores graphical objects described as a collection of polygons. The purpose of this file format was to establish a simple and easy file type that is general enough to be useful for a wide range of models. PLY file format comes as ASCII as well as Binary format for compact storage and for rapid saving and loading. The file format is used by different applications that provide support for 3D files reading.

A file with .drc extension is a compressed 3D file format created with Google Draco library. Google offers Draco as open source library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes and point clouds, and improves storage and transmission of 3D graphics. It encodes the input data and saves it as .drc file. At the receiving end, the API reads .drc files and can output these as PLY or OBJ files. The compressed output file enables users to download apps faster and provide quick loading of 3D graphics in browsers.
