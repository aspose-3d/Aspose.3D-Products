 In order to render ASE to 3DS, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.3D API makes it easy for the developers to convert ASE file to 3DS in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load ASE file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of 3dsSaveOptions
1.  Set 3DS specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with 3DS file extension & object of 3dsSaveOptions

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="3DS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3ds/" >}}

A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Sudio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
