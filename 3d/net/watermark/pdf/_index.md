 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to add blind watermark to the PDF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load PDF file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add watermark and password using Aspose.3D's EncodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

```cs

//The source file that needs to be watermarked and the output file after saving
string file = "template.pdf";
string output =System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".fbx";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);

//Add watermark and password to files
var numMeshes = 0;
scene.RootNode.Accept((Node node) =>

//Save the file in the format you want
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins.
