 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to view the JT file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JT file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Check resultant HTML file in default browser

```cs

string output = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".html";

// load JT scene via an instance of Scene
var scene = new ThreeD.Scene("template.jt");
// create an object of Html5SaveOptions and set properties for formatting
var options = new ThreeD.Formats.Html5SaveOptions()
{
    // turn off the grid
    ShowGrid = false,
    // turn off the user interface
    ShowUI = false
};

// save 3D scene as HTML5
scene.Save(output, options);
// load resultant HTML in default browser
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format. JT format is a scene graph that supports the attributes and nodes that are CAD specific. Sophisticated compression techniques are used to store facet data (triangles). This format is structured to support visual attributes, product and manufacturing information (PMI), and Metadata. There is a good support for asynchronous streaming of content. In heavy mechanical industry, professionals use JT file in their CAD solutions and product lifecycle management (PLM) software programs to examine the geometry of complicated goods.
