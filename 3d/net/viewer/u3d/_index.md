 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to view the U3D file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load U3D file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Check resultant HTML file in default browser

var scene = new ThreeD.Scene("template.u3d");
// create an object of Html5SaveOptions and set properties for formatting
var options = new ThreeD.Formats.Html5SaveOptions()
{
    // turn off the grid
    ShowGrid = false,
    // turn off the user interface
    ShowUI = false
};

// save 3D scene as HTML5
scene.Save(output, options);
// load resultant HTML in default browser
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards). U3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.
