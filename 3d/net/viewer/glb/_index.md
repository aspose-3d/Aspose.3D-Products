 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to view the GLB file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load GLB file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Check resultant HTML file in default browser

```cs

// load GLB scene via an instance of Scene
var scene = new ThreeD.Scene("template.glb");
// create an object of Html5SaveOptions and set properties for formatting
var options = new ThreeD.Formats.Html5SaveOptions()
{
    // turn off the grid
    ShowGrid = false,

// save 3D scene as HTML5
scene.Save(output, options);
// load resultant HTML in default browser

GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.
