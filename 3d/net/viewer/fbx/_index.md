 In order to view FBX file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with any Viewer. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to view the FBX file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load FBX file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object of Html5SaveOptions
1.  Check resultant HTML file in default browser

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# code to view FBX" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

string output = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".html";

// load FBX scene via an instance of Scene
var scene = new ThreeD.Scene("template.fbx");
// create an object of Html5SaveOptions and set properties for formatting
var options = new ThreeD.Formats.Html5SaveOptions()
{
    // turn off the grid
    ShowGrid = false,
    // turn off the user interface
    ShowUI = false
};

// save 3D scene as HTML5
scene.Save(output, options);
// load resultant HTML in default browser
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.
