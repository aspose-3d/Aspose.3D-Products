 In order to generate point cloud to GLTF file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with generate point cloud. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to generate point cloud to the GLTF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load GLTF file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get pointcloud object of Aspose.3D
-  Create a transform object through the EvaluateGlobalTransform method
-  Generate point cloud using Merge method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

```cs

//The source file that needs to generate the point cloud
string file = "template.gltf";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);

//Get pointcloud object of Aspose.3D and generate a point cloud
var pc = new PointCloud();
scene.RootNode.Accept((Node n) =>
{
    if (n.Entities.Count > 0)
    {
        var transform = n.EvaluateGlobalTransform(true);
        foreach (var entity in n.Entities)
        {
            if (entity is Geometry g)
            {
                Merge(pc, g, transform);
            }
            else if (entity is IMeshConvertible mc)
            {
                var mesh = mc.ToMesh();
                Merge(pc, mesh, transform);
            }

        }
    }
    return true;
});

//Merge method for generating point clouds
private void Merge(PointCloud pc, Geometry g, Matrix4 transform)
{
    var tmp = PointCloud.FromGeometry(g, 10);
    for (int i = 0; i < tmp.ControlPoints.Count; i++)
    {
        var pt = transform * tmp.ControlPoints[i];
        pc.ControlPoints.Add(pt);
    }
}

// create an instance of newScene
var newScene = new Scene(pc);

//When saving, you need to create a SaveOptions object of the save format
string output=System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".ply";
PlySaveOptions ply = new PlySaveOptions();
ply.PointCloud = true;
newScene.Save(output,ply);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.
