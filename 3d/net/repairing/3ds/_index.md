{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to repair the 3DS file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load 3DS file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Analyze the file itself for problems and fix them
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object
1.  Check resultant file in default browser

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
