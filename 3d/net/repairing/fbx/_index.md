 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to repair the FBX file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load FBX file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Analyze the file itself for problems and fix them
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object
1.  Check resultant file in default browser

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.
