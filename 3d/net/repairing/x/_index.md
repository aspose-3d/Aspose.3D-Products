 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to repair the X file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load X file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Analyze the file itself for problems and fix them
1.  Set properties for advanced formatting
1.  Call the Scene.Save method with object
1.  Check resultant file in default browser
