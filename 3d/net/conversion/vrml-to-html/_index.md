 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert VRML files to HTML in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of HtmlSaveOptions
1.  Set HTML specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with HTML file extension & object of HtmlSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant HTML file at specified path

The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages. The latest variant is known as HTML 5 that gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from server, where these are hosted, or can be loaded from local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others where each tag has start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.
