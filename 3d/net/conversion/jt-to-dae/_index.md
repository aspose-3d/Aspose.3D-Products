 In order to convert JT to DAE, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert JT files to DAE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JT file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Set DAE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with DAE file extension & object of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant DAE file at specified path

JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format. JT format is a scene graph that supports the attributes and nodes that are CAD specific. Sophisticated compression techniques are used to store facet data (triangles). This format is structured to support visual attributes, product and manufacturing information (PMI), and Metadata. There is a good support for asynchronous streaming of content. In heavy mechanical industry, professionals use JT file in their CAD solutions and product lifecycle management (PLM) software programs to examine the geometry of complicated goods.

A DAE file is a Digital Asset Exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506.
