 In order to convert VRML to STL, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert VRML files to STL in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of StlSaveOptions
1.  Set STL specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with STL file extension & object of StlSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant STL file at specified path

 Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.3D for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows VRML to STL C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the VRML in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.vrml");
// create an instance of StlSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.StlSaveOptions();
// save VRML as a STL 
document.Save("output.stl", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VRML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/vrml/" >}}
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="stl" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/stl/" >}}
STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.
