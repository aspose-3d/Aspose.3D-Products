 In order to convert OBJ to STL, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert OBJ files to STL in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load OBJ file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of StlSaveOptions
1.  Set STL specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with STL file extension & object of StlSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant STL file at specified path

```cs
// load the OBJ in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.obj");
// create an instance of StlSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.StlSaveOptions();
// save OBJ as a STL 
document.Save("output.stl", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OBJ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}
OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="stl" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/stl/" >}}
STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.
