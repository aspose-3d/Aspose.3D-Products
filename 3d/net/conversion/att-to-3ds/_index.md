 In order to convert ATT to 3DS, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert ATT files to 3DS in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load ATT file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set 3DS specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with 3DS file extension & object of Discreet3dsSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant 3DS file at specified path

```cs
// load the ATT in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.att");
// create an instance of Discreet3dsSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.Discreet3dsSaveOptions();
// save ATT as a 3DS 
document.Save("output.3ds", options);

A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
