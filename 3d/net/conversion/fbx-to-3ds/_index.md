 In order to convert FBX to 3DS, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert FBX files to 3DS in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load FBX file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of 3dsSaveOptions
1.  Set 3DS specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with 3DS file extension & object of 3dsSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant 3DS file at specified path

 Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.3D for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows FBX to 3DS C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the FBX in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.fbx");
// create an instance of 3dsSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.Discreet3dsSaveOptions();
// save FBX as a 3DS 
document.Save("output.3ds", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="3ds" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3ds/" >}}
A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
