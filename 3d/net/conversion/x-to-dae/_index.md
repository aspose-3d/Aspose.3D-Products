 In order to convert X to DAE, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d)

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert X files to DAE in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load X file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Set DAE specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with DAE file extension & object of DaeSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant DAE file at specified path

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="dae" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/dae/" >}}
A DAE file is a Digital Asset Exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506.
