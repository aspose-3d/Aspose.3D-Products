 In order to convert ASE to AMF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert ASE files to AMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load ASE file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set AMF specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with AMF file extension & object of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant AMF file at specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the ASE in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.ase");
// create an instance of AmfSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.AmfSaveOptions();
// save ASE as a AMF 
document.Save("output.amf", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

An ASE file is a 2D animation or graphics that contain layers, frames, palettes, tags, and settings.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="amf" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/amf/" >}}
Additive Manufacturing file format (AMF) defines open standards for objects description in order to be utilized by additive manufacturing processes such as 3D Printing. CAD programs use the AMF file format by making use of the information such as geometry, color and material of the objects. AMF is different than STL format as the lateral does not support color, materials, lattices, and constellations.
