 In order to convert JT to GLTF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert JT files to GLTF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load JT file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set GLTF specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with GLTF file extension & object of GltfSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant GLTF file at specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the JT in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.jt");
// create an instance of GltfSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.GltfSaveOptions();
// save JT as a GLTF 
document.Save("output.gltf", options);

JT (Jupiter Tessellation) is an efficient, industry-focused and flexible ISO-standardized 3D data format developed by Siemens PLM Software. Mechanical CAD domains of Aerospace, automotive industry, and Heavy Equipment use JT as their most leading 3D visualization format. JT format is a scene graph that supports the attributes and nodes that are CAD specific. Sophisticated compression techniques are used to store facet data (triangles). This format is structured to support visual attributes, product and manufacturing information (PMI), and Metadata. There is a good support for asynchronous streaming of content. In heavy mechanical industry, professionals use JT file in their CAD solutions and product lifecycle management (PLM) software programs to examine the geometry of complicated goods.

glTF (GL Transmission Format) is a 3D file format that stores 3D model information in JSON format. The use of JSON minimizes both the size of 3D assets and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. It was adopted for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF was developed by the Khronos Group 3D Formats Working Group and is also described as JPEG of 3D by its creators. The format defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry. The intention behind the creation of glTF file format was to define an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that should streamline authoring workflows and enable interoperable use of content across the industry. It minimizes runtime processing by applications using WebGL and other APIs.
