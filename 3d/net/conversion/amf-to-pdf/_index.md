 In order to convert AMF to PDF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert AMF files to PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load AMF file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of PdfSaveOptions
1.  Set PDF specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with PDF file extension & object of PdfSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant PDF file at specified path

```cs
// load the AMF in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.amf");
// create an instance of PdfSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.PdfSaveOptions();
// save AMF as a PDF 
document.Save("output.pdf", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="AMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/amf/" >}}
Additive Manufacturing file format (AMF) defines open standards for objects description in order to be utilized by additive manufacturing processes such as 3D Printing. CAD programs use the AMF file format by making use of the information such as geometry, color and material of the objects. AMF is different than STL format as the lateral does not support color, materials, lattices, and constellations.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
