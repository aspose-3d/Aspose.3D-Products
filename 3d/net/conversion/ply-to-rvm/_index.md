 In order to convert PLY to RVM, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert PLY files to RVM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PLY file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of RvmSaveOptions
1.  Set RVM specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with RVM file extension & object of RvmSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant RVM file at specified path

```cs
// load the PLY in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.ply");
// create an instance of RvmSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.RvmSaveOptions();
// save PLY as a RVM 
document.Save("output.rvm", options);

PLY, Polygon File Format, represents 3D file format that stores graphical objects described as a collection of polygons. The purpose of this file format was to establish a simple and easy file type that is general enough to be useful for a wide range of models. PLY file format comes as ASCII as well as Binary format for compact storage and for rapid saving and loading. The file format is used by different applications that provide support for 3D files reading.
