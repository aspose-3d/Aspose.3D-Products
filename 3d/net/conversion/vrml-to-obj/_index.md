 In order to convert VRML to OBJ, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to load & convert VRML files to OBJ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VRML file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of ObjSaveOptions
1.  Set OBJ specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.Save method
1.  Pass the output path with OBJ file extension & object of ObjSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant OBJ file at specified path

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the VRML in an object of Scene 
var document = new Aspose.ThreeD.Scene("template.vrml");
// create an instance of ObjSaveOptions 
var options = new Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.ObjSaveOptions();
// save VRML as a OBJ 
document.Save("output.obj", options);

 A 3D File Processing Library to manipulate 3D files without any modeling and rendering software. The 3D API supports Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, FBX (ASCII, Binary), STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, glTF, GLB, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco file formats and more. Developers can create, read, convert, modify and control the substance of 3D document formats easily.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VRML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/vrml/" >}}
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a file format for representation of interactive 3D world objects over the World Wide Web (www). It finds its usage in creating three-dimensional representations of complex scenes such as illustrations, definition and virtual reality presentations. The format has been superseded by X3D. Many 3D modelling applications can  save objects and scenes in VRML format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="obj" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}
OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.
